# OpenZephir AV — Core Antivirus Engine 🧬

OpenZephir AV is the foundational antivirus component of the OpenZephir Security Platform — a modular, auditable, and developer-first security engine.

🧠 **Key Features**
- Written in C++ for performance and portability  
- Exposes a simple, stable C ABI (`zephir_scan_file`, `zephir_initialize`, etc.)
- Signature- and heuristic-based scanning (conceptually similar to YARA)
- JSON-based result reporting
- Designed for safe interop with higher-level services via C#, Python, or API wrappers

⚙️ **Architecture Overview**

+------------------------+
|  OpenZephir Service    | <-- C# Wrapper / Windows Service
+----------^-------------+
           |
           v
+------------------------+
|   Zephir Core Engine   | <-- Native C++ scanning module
|   - Signature DB       |
|   - Heuristic rules    |
+------------------------+


🧩 **Goals**
- 100% transparent, auditable core  
- Safe-by-design scanning (no unsafe code execution)
- Extendable via plugin or rule system
